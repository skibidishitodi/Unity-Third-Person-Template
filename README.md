Basic 2 Script TPS Template for unity. The Project was made in a few hours, So its not great.
This comes with fully set up animations, A gun (not coded) but if you ADS, It appears.
This was made with Mixamo, Unity, And VSC.
I made this in Unity 2022.3.32f1, So if you have version errors, switch.
If your feet are in the ground, Adjust the Ground Check Distance, I use 0.

If you have a weird walking bug, I recommend just making a empty gameobject inside the Player, THen assigning that as the Camera in the Player Script (The movement is way different).
